**PROBLEM STATEMENT**:

Learners often struggle to quickly locate precise answers within lengthy educational videos, leading to inefficiencies and a less effective learning experience. Traditional search systems fail to provide targeted, content-specific responses directly from the video, limiting the depth and relevance of information retrieval.
This project aims to enhance video-based learning by creating a system that delivers accurate, context-aware answers derived strictly from the video content, improving learning outcomes and accessibility.
